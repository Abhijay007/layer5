<p>
Benchmarking a service mesh and your workloadâ€™s performance is no simple task.

Questions arise like:

Which load generator should you use and what signals should you measure?
How long should I run a test?
How has the performance of service meshes evolved over time?
Should I run tests from outside or within my cluster?
How does the configuration of my service mesh affect performance?

This talk answers these questions by empowering attendees with at-hand tooling for continual evaluation of their service mesh environment and a reflection of how service mesh deployment models affect performance.
